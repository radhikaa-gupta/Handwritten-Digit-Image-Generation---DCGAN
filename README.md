# Handwritten Digit Image Generation using DCGAN
In this project, advanced techniques called **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** were used to train an artificial intelligence (AI) model. This model learned from a dataset of handwritten digits called **MNIST**. After training, the AI was able to g**enerate new images that looked like digits written by humans**. This process involved teaching the AI to understand patterns in the dataset and create realistic images of handwritten digits. The project was implemented in Python using TensorFlow and Keras, two popular tools for building deep learning models. Through this project, valuable insights were gained into how AI can generate images that resemble human handwriting.
